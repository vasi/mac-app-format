appFormat.pl: Show the executable formats of Mac applications
=============================================================

Macs have gone through a long series of different executable formats. This script helps to identify them.

-----------

Usage: appFormat.pl [--old] PATH

This will search PATH for Mac applications. For each one it finds, it will print its path, and its format.

If the --old flag is used, it will only display applications that will not run on current Mac operating systems.

NOTE: This script only runs on Mac OS X.

-----------

Recognized formats and architectutes, from oldest to newest:

* CODE resource, on 68k
* Code Fragment Manager, on 68k and PPC
* Preferred Executable Format on PPC
* Mach-O, on PPC, x86, AMD64, ARM and others

Of these, only Mach-O on x86 and AMD64 are considered 'new'.

Many weird and wonderful combinations exist:

* PEF executables invariably are CFM as well
* 'Fat binaries' contain both CODE and PEF, for m68k and PPC
* 'Universal binaries' are Mach-O, with multiple architectures
* Mach-O executables can be big- or little-endian
